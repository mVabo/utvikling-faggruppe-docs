# Dependencies

Since this application is rather simple, we will start by installing the only dependency we need.

Normally you would install depencencies as you go, but for simplicity in this workshop we will get it done right away.

## dotnet

Run the following command to install the SqlClient package with dotnet-cli

```bash
~$ dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient
```

## NuGet

The following command will install the same package as above with a package manager

```bash
~$ NuGet\Install-Package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient
```
