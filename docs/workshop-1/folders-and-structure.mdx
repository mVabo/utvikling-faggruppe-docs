# Folders and structure

In this workshop we will use a standard folder structure that follows Microsoft guidelines.

## Starting point

When initializing the project it should look like this:

```folder
- bin
- Data
  - WeatherForecast.cs
  - WeatherForecastService.cs
- obj (We shouldn't touch this)
- Pages
  - \_Host.cshtml
  - Counter.razor
  - Error.cshtml
  - Error.cshtml.cs
  - FetchData.razor
  - Index.razor
- Properties
  - launchSettings.json
- Shared
  - MainLayout.razor
  - MainLayout.razor.css
  - NavMenu.razor
  - NavMenu.razor.css
  - SurveyPrompt.razor
- wwwroot (We shouldn't touch this)
- \_Imports.razor
- App.razor
- appsettings.Development.json
- appsettings.json
- Program.cs
- Test.csproj
```

## Removing bloat

### Layout

Since we only need ~3 pages max, we don't want to spend time and add complexity by making layouts,
for this reason, we're going to delete the layouts that comes with the template

1. First you need to remove all files within the `Shared` folder, but keep the folder.

2. You should get a couple errors now, to remove them head over to `App.razor` and delete all references like this:

Before:

```cs
<Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
    <Found Context="routeData">
        <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />
        <FocusOnNavigate RouteData="@routeData" Selector="h1" />
    </Found>
    <NotFound>
        <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
        <LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)">
            <p role="alert">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
        </LayoutView>
    </NotFound>
</Router>
```

After:

```cs
<Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
    <Found Context="routeData">
        <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" />
        <FocusOnNavigate RouteData="@routeData" Selector="h1" />
    </Found>
    <NotFound>
        <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
        <LayoutView>
            <p role="alert">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
        </LayoutView>
    </NotFound>
</Router>
```

3. Since the `Shared` folder is empty, we need to remove the import in `_Imports.razor`.

- Just delete the line `@using BlazorApp.Shared`

### Data

We wont need any of the contents in the `Data` folder, so you can go ahead and delete this entirely.

1. Like we did with `Layout`, we need to remove all references from the `Program.cs` file, the following lines should be deleted:

```cs
using BlazorApp.Data;
```

```cs
builder.Services.AddSingleton<WeatherForecastService>();
```

## Adding folders that we're going to use

:::tip Be aware

When executing the commands, be sure you're in the project folder in your terminal

:::

### Services

The services folder will be holding all of our service related files, like our database-service.

```bash
~$ mkdir Layouts
```

### Models

The models folder will be holding all of our models, like player and spaceship.

```bash
~$ mkdir Models
```

### Interfaces

The interfaces folder will be holding all of our interfaces.

```bash
~$ mkdir Interfaces
```

### Migrations _(optional)_

You could also add a migrations folder for keeping all of your SQL migration files, its a nice touch
and makes it easier to keep track of all the changes you've made.

```bash
~$ mkdir Migrations
```
