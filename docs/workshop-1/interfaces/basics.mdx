# Basics

Interfaces are used as contracts when creating a class or struct that must provide a given implementation.

In this workshop it is a bit overkill and will only be used as an example.

## IDatabaseService

Go ahead and create the file `IDatabaseService.cs` inside `./Interfaces`.

When you're done you can copy-paste the following into your file:

```cs title="./Interfaces/IDatabaseService.cs"
namespace BlazorApp.Interfaces;

using BlazorApp.Models;

public interface IDatabaseService
{
  Task<List<Player>> GetPlayers();
  Task<Player?> GetUniquePlayer(int Id);
  Task<int> AddPlayer(Player player);
  Task<int> WithdrawMoney(Player player, int amount);
  Task<List<Spaceship>> GetSpaceships(String userId);
  Task<int> AddSpaceship(Spaceship spaceship);
  Task<Boolean> SellSpaceship(Spaceship spaceship);
}
```

It contains the bare minimum for having a functional app and should be implemented in our `DatabaseService` which you should create under `Services` resulting in this:

```cs title="./Services/DatabaseService.cs"
namespace BlazorApp.Services;

using BlazorApp.Models;

public class DatabaseService : IDatabaseService
{

}
```
