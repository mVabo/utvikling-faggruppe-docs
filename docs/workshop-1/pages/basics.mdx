# Basics

Before we jump in and try to create our whole game, its nice to know the basics of Razor components/pages

## File placement and conventions

### Placement

For our purpose, we should keep all of our pages/componets within the `./Pages` folder, but normally it would be
standard practice to also have a `./Components` folder

### Conventions

Pages follows basic .NET naming conventions and should be camel-case and start with a capital letter like `StartExample`. The name should be followed by the `.razor`
extension and the result should be: `StartExample.razor`

## Page vs Component

In the razor component you have to declare it as a page in the top for it to be mapped. By declaring a component with `@page "/start"`

## Structure

In the right order:

1. Declarations
2. Styling
3. HTML
4. Code/functions

## Declarations

### Using

If we want to use models or services in our code, we need to delcare that we're using a given namespace with the following line:

_This example declares that we want to use everything within our Models folder/namespace_

```razor
@using BlazorApp.Models
```

### Inject

When we want to use services like our database-service we need to inject it into our component.

_This example declares that we want to use the Services folder/namespace and injects the service into our code_

```razor
@using BlazorApp.Services
@inject IDatabaseService databaseService
```

## Styling

After we have our declarations in order, we can add style tags that will contain or styling later on

Style tags looks like this

```razor
<style>
  .styling-goes-here {}
</style>
```

## HTML

HTML can be put everywhere in the file, but to keep a nice structure that provides structure we place it between the styling and the code/functions.
Best practice is to wrap the code in an element so its all controllable later on, like this

```razor
<div>
  <restOfYourCodeHere>
    <andHere />
  </restOfYourCodeHere>
</div>
```

## Code/Functions

Inside the code declaration we can store functions and variables, here is what it looks like:

```razor
@code {
  String name = "";

  private async Task DoSomething()
  {
    // Do something
  }
}
```

## Complete example

```razor
@page "/"

<style>
  .container {
    color: black
  }
</style>

<div class="continaer" @onclick="@HandleClick">
  <p>Hello world</p>
</div>

@code {
  public void HandleClick()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
  }
}
```
