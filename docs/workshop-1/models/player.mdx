# Player

`./Models/Player.cs`

The player class should define all the properties a player can have and contain a constructor

## Basics

In this workshop you need to get creative and a good way is to add your own properties, but here is an example from our template

```cs title="./Models/Player.cs"
namespace BlazorApp.Models;

public class Player
{
  public int ID { get; set; }

  public String? Name { get; set; }

  public int Balance { get; set; }

  public String? HomePlanet { get; set; }

  public DateTime Created { get; set; }

  public Player()
  {
    ID = 0;
    Name = "";
    Balance = 2000;
    HomePlanet = "";
    Created = DateTime.MinValue;
  }
}
```
