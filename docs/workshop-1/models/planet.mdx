# Planet

`./Models/Planet.cs`

The planet class should define all the properties a player can have and contain a constructor

## Basics

In this workshop you need to get creative and a good way is to add your own properties, but here is an example from our template

:::tip Visuals

This class needs an image property for later use

:::

```cs title="./Models/Planet.cs"
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace BlazorApp.Models;

public class Planet
{
  public int ID { get; set; }

  [Required]
  public string Name { get; set; }

  [Required]
  public string Description { get; set; }

  public Planet(String Name, String Description)
  {
    this.Name = Name;
    this.Description = Description;
  }
}
```
