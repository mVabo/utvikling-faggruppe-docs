# Branching

Branching is an important strategy when working in teams. It lets the team work on separate "branches" of the
main codebase and later on lets everyone merge their code safely into the codebase.

## Naming conventions

### By Type

This convetion is based on the type, which can be one of the following

- Feature
- Bug
- Improvement

- Any other the team decides to include

So a branch with this convention could be `feature/new-landingpage`

### By Person

This convention is based by the person pushing the code. So a branch with this convention would be named `aadne-garstad/new-landingpage`

## Creating a new branch

Use the following command to create a new branch

```bash
~$ git branch -b "feature/feature-name"
```

Now you can push and fetch code like normally and create a PR when you're ready to merge your code with the main codebase
